## üéÆ **GAME SETUP**

### **Deck Construction**
- **Minimum 40 cards** (recommended mix includes bandwidth cards)
- **Suggested ratio:** 30% Bandwidth, 25% Engineers/Services, 45% Tools/Upgrades/Practices

### **Starting Conditions**
- Each player starts with **5 cards** in hand
- **20 Service Health**
- **0 Uptime Points**
- **1 base bandwidth** per turn
- Shuffle your deck and place it face-down

---

## üîÑ **TURN STRUCTURE**

### **Phase 1: Start of Turn**
1. **Generate Bandwidth:** Add your bandwidth generation to existing pool
   - Base: 1 bandwidth per turn
   - Plus: +1 for each deployed Bandwidth card
   - Plus: Environment bonuses (if any)
2. **Draw 1 Card** from your deck
3. **Service Uptime:** Services generate UP every 3rd turn deployed
4. **Automatic Effects:** Kubernetes healing, tool effects, etc.

### **Phase 2: Main Phase**
- **Play Cards:** Spend bandwidth to deploy cards from your hand
- **Multiple Cards:** Can play multiple cards if you have bandwidth
- **Free Cards:** Bandwidth cards always cost 0
- **Saving Bandwidth:** Unused bandwidth carries over to next turn

### **Phase 3: End Turn**
- **Declare End:** Pass turn to opponent
- **Hand Limit:** No maximum hand size
- **Incident Check:** Random incidents may trigger based on Security Posture

---

## üí∞ **BANDWIDTH SYSTEM**

### **Key Mechanics**
- **Accumulation:** Unused bandwidth carries over (like MTG mana)
- **Generation:** Each turn adds new bandwidth to your existing pool
- **Strategy:** Save up for expensive cards or spend immediately

### **Example Bandwidth Flow**
```
Turn 1: 1 bandwidth ‚Üí Play Server Rack (free) ‚Üí End with 1 bandwidth
Turn 2: 1 + 2 = 3 bandwidth ‚Üí Play Junior Dev (1 cost) ‚Üí End with 2 bandwidth
Turn 3: 2 + 2 = 4 bandwidth ‚Üí Save up ‚Üí End with 4 bandwidth
Turn 4: 4 + 2 = 6 bandwidth ‚Üí Play expensive card ‚Üí Continue...
```

## üèÜ **WIN CONDITIONS**

### **Victory Method 1: Uptime Points**
- **Target:** First player to reach 20 UP wins
- **Generation:** Services generate UP every 3 turns
- **Bonus Sources:** Some Practices and special effects

### **Victory Method 2: Service Health**
- **Target:** Reduce opponent's Service Health to 0
- **Damage Sources:** Incidents, attacks, system failures
- **Defense:** Engineers, tools, and practices can mitigate damage

---

## üö® **INCIDENT SYSTEM**

### **Incident Triggers**
- **Random Events:** Based on Security Posture (lower = more incidents)
- **Opponent Cards:** Some cards may trigger incidents
- **Automatic:** Certain game states may cause incidents

### **Incident Resolution**
- **Immediate Effect:** Damage occurs when incident triggers
- **Mitigation:** Can be reduced by Engineers, Tools, or spending bandwidth
- **Severity Levels:** Low, Moderate, High, Critical

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **ADVANCED MECHANICS**

### **Team Morale**
- **Calculation:** Sum of all Engineers' Morale Impact
- **Effects:** Positive morale provides various bonuses
- **Affected By:** Incidents can reduce morale

### **Security Posture**
- **Scale:** 0-100 (50 is starting value)
- **Effects:** Higher security = fewer random incidents
- **Improved By:** Security Engineers, security tools

### **Tech Debt Tokens**
- **Accumulation:** Gained by rushing deployment or skipping practices
- **Consequences:** May trigger failures or reduce efficiency
- **Mitigation:** Code Reviews and other practices can reduce tech debt

### **Blameless Culture Meter**
- **Hidden Metric:** Tracks team culture health
- **Effects:** High blameless culture reduces incident severity
- **Improved By:** Postmortems, good management practices

## üìã **CARD INTERACTION RULES**

### **Deployment Rules**
- **Bandwidth Cards:** Can always be played (cost 0)
- **Multiple Engineers:** Can have multiple Engineers of same type
- **Single Environment:** Only one Environment active at a time
- **Tool Stacking:** Multiple tools can be active simultaneously

### **Timing Rules**
- **Immediate Effects:** Practices and some tools activate immediately
- **Persistent Effects:** Engineers, Services, Tools remain until destroyed
- **Turn-Based Effects:** Service uptime, bandwidth generation occur each turn

### **Destruction Rules**
- **Engineer Health:** Engineers can be damaged by incidents
- **Service Health:** Services can be damaged, affecting uptime generation
- **Permanent Destruction:** Cards with 0 health are removed from play

## üéØ **STRATEGY TIPS**

### **Early Game (Turns 1-3)**
- **Priority:** Deploy Bandwidth cards for economy
- **Foundation:** Get 3-4 bandwidth sources quickly
- **Defense:** Consider basic monitoring tools

### **Mid Game (Turns 4-7)**
- **Development:** Deploy Engineers and Services

- **Efficiency:** Use accumulated bandwidth for power plays

### **Late Game (Turns 8+)**
- **Power Plays:** Deploy expensive, game-changing cards
- **Protection:** Maintain security and incident response
- **Victory Push:** Focus on win conditions

### **Universal Tips**
- **Economy First:** Bandwidth cards are crucial - don't neglect them
